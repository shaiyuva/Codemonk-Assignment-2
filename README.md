# Fashion Product Image Classification
Overview:
This project focuses on classifying fashion product images into predefined categories using deep learning. The model leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transfer Learning techniques to achieve high accuracy in image classification.

Dataset:

The dataset consists of fashion product images labeled into various categories (e.g., shirts, pants, dresses, shoes).
Images are preprocessed by resizing, normalizing, and augmenting to improve model generalization.

Model Architecture:

The classification model is built using CNN-based architectures, including:

ResNet50 (for deep feature extraction and classification)
VGG16 (for structured feature learning)
EfficientNet (for optimized accuracy and efficiency)
MobileNet (for lightweight and fast inference)

Training Details:

Loss Function: Categorical Cross-Entropy
Optimizer: Adam / SGD
Metrics Used: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
Validation Strategy: Train-Test split with model evaluation using a Confusion Matrix
Results
The model was trained for multiple epochs, achieving a high classification accuracy.
Evaluation metrics indicate strong performance across different categories.
